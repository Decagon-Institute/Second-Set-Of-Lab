//withoutString function, removes all instances of one string from another
//The string to be removed is called "remove" and the string from which the string remove is removed is called the base
//This program will find and remove all instances of "remove" from "base"
//You can assume that the length of remove is one (1) or more.
// A given base for example `emmanuel` and remove for example `m` will return 'eanuel'
